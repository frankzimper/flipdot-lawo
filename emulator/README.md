# Flip Dot Display Emulator

This is a simple tool to test the ESP32-Code on a PC. The Python script reads the ESP32 console-output from the USB port and then toggles TK checkboxes.

## Geting started

1. Load the ESP32 code (either demo-window or demo-door) onto the ESP32.
1. Run fdde.py
1. Eventually reset the ESP32 so that it starts from the beginning.
